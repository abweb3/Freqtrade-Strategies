# 🤖 Freqtrade-Strategies

Just a place to store Freqtrade Strategies (.py only). Note You'll need to run your own freqtrade instance, this is just a strategy. 

And, If you don't know what that means, maybe check ou the documentation here: https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/

It looks intimidating but, super simple and quick to get started with. If you feel lost, reach out, I'll do my best to helpout ✌️
